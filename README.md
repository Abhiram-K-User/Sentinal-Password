# Sentinel

## Sentinel is a real-time password security tool that:

Scans a password’s exposure on the internet

Measures true security strength

Shows strength using a speedometer gauge

Generates stronger password suggestions that preserve the user’s original password pattern and memorability

Never stores or uploads the password or user data

The system runs entirely in the browser — no backend, no logging, no storage.
